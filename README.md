:point_right: Clean Architecture:
-----------------

</div>


:point_right: Domain & Data Layer:
-----------------
<div align="center">

</div>


:point_right: Presentation Layer:
-----------------
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Mina-Mikhail/Kotlin-Base-MVVM/blob/master/images/ui_layer.png">
</div>


:point_right: Architecture:
-----------------
- Following Clean Architecture.
- MVVM Architecture.
- Repository pattern.
- Use Cases.
- Applying SOLID principles, each class has a single job with separation of concerns by making classes independent
  of each other and communicating with interfaces.
- Using Kotlin-KTS & buildSrc to handle project dependencies.


:point_right: Tech Stack & Libraries:
-----------------
- Navigation component - navigation graph for navigating and replacing screens/fragments
- DataBinding - allows to more easily write code that interacts with views and replaces ```findViewById```.
- ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
- Flow & StateFlow - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection. Object creation and scoping is handled by Hilt.
- Kotlin Coroutines - for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
- Retrofit2 & OkHttp3 - to make REST requests to the web service integrated.
- Coil - for image loading.
- Material Bottom Navigation - to handle bottom tabs with support for multiple backStack.


:point_right: Project Structure:
-----------------
- Sample includes some basic features required in each project like :
  - Splash.
  - App Tutorial.
  - Login - (With Business Logic).
  - Sign Up - (Blank Screens).
  - Forgot Password -(Blanck Screens).
  - Home Screen - (Contains 3 Tabs with 3 NavGraphs).


:point_right: Extra Modules:
-----------------
- You will find extra modules also developed by me like :
  - AppTutorial - (To handle onBoarding tutorial screens).
  - ActionChooser - (A customized pop up with recyclerView of single selection).
  - PrettyPopUp (A customized pop up to display message to user with two actions (positive & negative buttons)).
  - ImagesSlider (An images slider supports auto scrolling for images from url and support GIF images).


:point_right: Code Style:
-----------
- Following official kotlin code style


:point_right: Apply Git Hooks:
-----------
- To apply git hooks in order to automate process of styling and checking your code, just follow this steps:
  - Copy ```pre-commit``` file depending on your OS from ```myGitHooks```.
  - Paste it into ```.git/hooks``` in your project.
- Now each time you commit your changes, ```ktlintFormat``` and  ```ktlintCheck``` will automatically run


:point_right: Local Development:
-----------
- Here are some useful Gradle commands for executing this example:
  - `./gradlew clean` - Deletes build directory.


:point_right: TO DO:
-----------
- [X] Apply ktlint for checking code style.
- [X] Use git hooks to automate code checking and styling before any new commit.
- [X] Use Flow in Domain layer.
- [X] Use StateFlow in Presentation layer.
- [X] Use UseCases.
- [X] Handle Different Build Variants.
- [ ] Use Ktor as network client instead of Retrofit & OKHTTP.
- [ ] Use Data Store instead of Shared Preferences.
- [ ] Explore full MVI implementation.
- [ ] Add some unit tests.
